2.0.0 - Repalced calls to deprecated String.strip with String.trim.  Makes minimum Elixir Version 1.3.  If you need to run on versions prior to 1.3 you can use the 1.0.0 version.  Bumped the major version as this may be a breaking change for some folks.

1.0.0 - Changed the way comments were parsed to make it more compatible with other libraries

0.2.1 - Small code changes to address a compiler warning from Elixir 1.2.3

0.1.0
0.2.0 - Identical releases caused by author's inexperience with hex
